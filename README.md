# :boom: Base :boom:
### :trophy: A Simple Console Game :trophy:

Base *(name pending)* is a project I am working on as a kind of beacon in the night sky to guide myself towards a better understanding of:
- [x] C# console application development
- [X] Core and advanced Git techniques
- [x] The basics of game engine development

This project is open to anyone, should you find something I am doing in it interesting, feel free to branch it and enjoy yourself!



Cheers,
